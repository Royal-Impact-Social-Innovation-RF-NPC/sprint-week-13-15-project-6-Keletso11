# Waste_Sorter
A smart waste sorter system powered by an ESP32 Dev Board and ESP32-CAM, featuring servo-controlled bins and AI-based object detection for classifying plastic, paper, and organic waste.

---

## Project Overview

This smart bin automatically sorts waste based on what object is detected by the camera.  
A trained Edge Impulse model runs on the ESP32-CAM and sends the classification result via UART to the ESP32 board, which controls servo motors to open the correct bin lid.

 **Object detection with ML (Edge Impulse + ESP32-CAM)**  
 **Three servo-controlled waste compartments**  
 **OLED display + LEDs for visual feedback**  
 **Laser-cut enclosure (DXF + ZIP provided)**  
 **Fully open-source hardware + code**

## Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)

The model is trained using **image classification** with 3 waste categories:

- **Organic**
- **Paper**
- **Plastic**

Training is done via Edge Impulse Studio, then exported as an Arduino library for the ESP32-CAM.

 Early training accuracy: **0% (poor) — no classification**  
 After more data + retraining: **50% accuracy and improving**
